		body : "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States cautioned on Wednesday it was ready to use force if need be to stop North Korea's nuclear missile program but said it preferred global diplomatic action against Pyongyang for defying world powers by test launching a ballistic missile that could hit Alaska. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told a meeting of the U.N. Security Council that North Korea's actions were \"quickly closing off the possibility of a diplomatic solution\" and the United States was prepared to defend itself and its allies. \"One of our capabilities lies with our considerable military forces. We will use them if we must, but we prefer not to have to go in that direction,\" Haley said. She urged China, North Korea's only major ally, to do more to rein in Pyongyang. Speaking with his Japanese counterpart on Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis underscored the \"ironclad commitment\" of the United States to defending Japan and providing \"extended deterrence using the full range of U.S. capabilities,\" Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said in a statement. Mattis' assurances to Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada came during a phone call to discuss the North Korean test, the statement said. Taking a major step in its missile program, North Korea on Tuesday test launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that some experts believe has the range to reach the U.S. states of Alaska and Hawaii and perhaps the U.S. Pacific Northwest. North Korea says the missile could carry a large nuclear warhead. The missile test is a direct challenge to U.S. President Donald Trump, who has vowed to prevent North Korea from being able to hit the United States with a nuclear missile. He has frequently urged China to press the isolated country's leadership to give up its nuclear program. Haley said the United States would propose new U.N. sanctions on North Korea in coming days and warned that if Russia and China did not support the move, then “we will go our own path.” Related Coverage Can U.S. defend against North Korea missiles? Not everyone agrees Russia says military force against N.Korea should be excluded U.S. diplomat heads to Asia but no talks with North Korea scheduled     She did not give details on what sanctions would be proposed, but outlined possible options. \"The international community can cut off the major sources of hard currency to the North Korean regime. We can restrict the flow of oil to their military and their weapons programs. We can increase air and maritime restrictions. We can hold senior regime officials accountable,\" Haley said. Diplomats say Beijing has not been fully enforcing existing international sanctions on its neighbor and has resisted tougher measures, such as an oil embargo, bans on the North Korean airline and guest workers, and measures against Chinese banks and other firms doing business with the North. “Much of the burden of enforcing U.N. sanctions rests with China,” Haley said. The United States might seek to take unilateral action and sanction more Chinese companies that do business with North Korea, especially banks, U.S. officials have said. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un looks on during the test-launch of the intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-14 in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang July 5, 2017. KCNA/via REUTERS China's U.N. ambassador, Liu Jieyi, told the Security Council meeting that the missile launch was a \"flagrant violation\" of U.N. resolutions and \"unacceptable.\" \"We call on all the parties concerned to exercise restraint, avoid provocative actions and belligerent rhetoric, demonstrate the will for unconditional dialogue and work actively together to defuse the tension,\" Liu said. Tensions With u.s. The United States has remained technically at war with North Korea since the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty and the past six decades have been punctuated by periodic rises in antagonism and rhetoric that have always stopped short of a resumption of active hostilities. Tensions have risen sharply after North Korea conducted two nuclear weapons tests last year and carried out a steady stream of ballistic missile tests North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said the ICBM test completed his country's strategic weapons capability that includes atomic and hydrogen bombs, the state KCNA news agency said. Slideshow (18 Images) Pyongyang will not negotiate with the United States to give up those weapons until Washington abandons its hostile policy against the North, KCNA quoted Kim as saying. \"He, with a broad smile on his face, told officials, scientists and technicians that the U.S. would be displeased ... as it was given a 'package of gifts' on its 'Independence Day,'\" KCNA said, referring to the missile launch on July 4. Trump and other leaders from the Group of 20 nations meeting in Germany this week are due to discuss steps to rein in North Korea's weapons program, which it has pursued in defiance of Security Council sanctions. Russia's deputy U.N. envoy said on Wednesday that military force should not be considered against North Korea and called for a halt to the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea. He also said that attempts to strangle North Korea economically were \"unacceptable\" and that sanctions would not resolve the issue. The U.S. military assured Americans that it was capable of defending the United States against a North Korean ICBM. Pentagon spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis noted a successful test last month in which a U.S.-based missile interceptor knocked down a simulated incoming North Korean ICBM. \"So we do have confidence in our ability to defend against the limited threat, the nascent threat that is there,\" he told reporters. He acknowledged though that previous U.S. missile defense tests had shown \"mixed results.\" The North Korean launch this week was both earlier and \"far more successful than expected,\" said U.S.-based missile expert John Schilling, a contributor to Washington-based North Korea monitoring project 38 North. It would now probably only be a year or two before a North Korean ICBM achieved \"minimal operational capability,\" he added. Schilling said the U.S. national missile defense system was \"only minimally operational\" and would take more than two years to upgrade to provide more reliable defense.

		body : "It was a Fourth of July firework that President Trump once vowed would never get off the ground, but the intercontinental Hwasong-14 missile launched Tuesday by North Korea has the potential to alter permanently the balance of power in East Asia. U.S. and international military analysts were still scrambling to determine the exact capabilities of the missile, but there was little question Pyongyang had made a quantum leap in its military reach, with the 37-minute flight that soared 1,700 miles into the atmosphere before landing 500 miles to the east in the East Sea/Sea of Japan . On a flatter trajectory, analysts say, the same missile could threaten all of Alaska. \n\nSEE ALSO: Kim vows North Korea’s nukes are not on negotiation table\n\nEven as the launch was being studied, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson appeared to confirm Tuesday night that the U.S. government believes that North Korea possesses an intercontinental ballistic missile. “Testing an ICBM represents a new escalation of the threat to the U.S., our allies and partners, and the world,” Mr. Tillerson said in a statement. In what could be seen as an expression of mounting U.S. frustration with China , Mr. Tillerson said, “Any country that hosts North Korean guest workers, provides any economic or military benefits or fails to fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions is aiding and abetting a dangerous regime.” \n\nSEE ALSO: Nikki Haley seeks emergency meeting of U.N. Security Council\n\nWhile the regime of Kim Jong-un has long pursued nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them, the test Tuesday was “far more successful than expected,” U.S. missile specialist John Schilling of the North Korean monitoring program 38 North told the Reuters news agency. Many North Korea watchers believed the regime was years away from achieving what it did Tuesday. The Trump administration and governments around the region were quick to condemn the missile launch, but also faced the hard reality that there was little short of military action that would force North Korea to back down. Economically isolated and under the dictatorial control of the Kim regime, Pyongyang has frustrated multiple U.S. presidents who have tried to slow down its drive for nuclear weapons. “There is no good option here,” former acting CIA Director Michael J. Morell told “CBS This Morning.” “There is no option to [take out the North’s nuclear programs] that wouldn’t start a second Korean war and wouldn’t raise the possibility of [ Mr. Kim ] using nuclear weapons against his neighbors.” Japan , South Korea and the U.S. have scheduled an emergency meeting at the Group of 20 summit this week in Hamburg, Germany. The North’s provocative military activities already figured to be a major topic of conversation. In a series of tweets before he took office, Mr. Trump predicted that North Korea ’s acquisition of a nuclear bomb that could threaten the U.S. mainland “won’t happen.” He belittled Mr. Kim and again expressed frustration that China , the North’s economic lifeline and sole ally, had failed to rein in its troublesome neighbor. On Monday, Mr. Trump tweeted, “Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?” The president, who has said the “era of strategic patience” with the North is over, suggested that regional allies of China and the U.S. now have a greater incentive to take a tough approach. “Hard to believe South Korea and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all.” One American response came swiftly as the U.S. 8th Army said in a statement that the U.S. and South Korean militaries fired precision “deep strike” missiles in response. The missiles landed in South Korea’s territorial waters, the statement said. But with the U.N. Security Council expected to take up the North Korean missile launch at a closed-door session Wednesday, China and Russia implied that Washington’s moves were exacerbating the crisis. “ China ’s role is indispensable,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said after calling the North’s missile tests a clear violation of U.N. sanctions. “We hope all sides can meet each other halfway.” In a joint statement, China and Russia are proposing that the North agree to suspend its ballistic missile testing program in exchange for a halt to joint South Korean-U.S. military exercises. The Pentagon says the exercises are vital to protect its ally, which is living under the threat of Pyongyang ’s conventional military forces. North Korea has condemned the exercises as a rehearsal for an invasion. Beijing and Moscow also took the opportunity to condemn the newly installed U.S. THAAD missile defense system in South Korea, which both countries fear can be used against their missiles. The launch was the 12th this year for North Korea , but the regime clearly saw the range and scope of the Hwasong-14 as a possible game-changer. Footage on state-controlled TV showed Mr. Kim and his generals monitoring the test in real time, and the female newscaster who typically announces such breakthroughs said the purported home-grown ICBM was a “glistening miracle” that demonstrated the “unwithering power of our state.” While the world has condemned the North’s nuclear and missile programs as deeply destabilizing, the North Koreans insisted they were acting in self-defense. As a nuclear power with an ICBM “capable of hitting any part of the world,” North Korea “will fundamentally terminate the U.S. nuclear war threats and blackmail and credibly protect the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula and the region,” Pyongyang said in a statement read on national TV. North Korean officials said the missile was launched at an unusually high trajectory to keep it from hitting any other countries in the region. On a flatter trajectory, military analysts calculated Tuesday, the missile could fly more than 4,000 miles. Despite the North’s boasting, Western analysts say Pyongyang still faces significant technical hurdles in improving the reliability of its missiles and in fashioning a nuclear device small enough to fit on the missile. Two tests this year were abruptly terminated shortly after launch in what are still unexplained circumstances. The latest test began at approximately 9:40 a.m. local time Tuesday from an airfield near the northwestern town of Kusong. Japanese officials said they believe the missile landed in the ocean inside Japan ’s exclusive economic zone — a target possibly chosen to make recovery and analysis of the missile hard for the U.S. and its allies. Aside from Mr. Trump ’s tweets and Mr. Tillerson ’s statement, the U.S. administration largely kept to its policy of not officially reacting to North Korean missile tests. With Congress in recess for the Fourth of July , the reaction on Capitol Hill was muted too. Sen. Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, pressed Mr. Trump in a statement to consider direct diplomacy with the North and “increased economic sanctions pressure from China .” Mr. Trump “must realize that there is no military solution to this threat,” Mr. Markey said. “Unilateral action will only escalate tension, increase the paranoia of Kim Jong-un and bring us closer to what everyone agrees would be a catastrophic war.” Private analysts largely agreed that the U.S. and its allies were facing a series of bad choices over what to do about North Korea , and that time was slipping away. Patrick Cronin, an Asia analyst with the Center for a New American Security, told The Associated Press that Mr. Trump was probably “coming to the point of no return” with North Korea . “We either go to the diplomatic table with Kim Jong-un or we do take some course of action,” Mr. Cronin said. “In all probability, we do both.” • This article is based in part on wire service reports. \nLOAD COMMENTS ( 189 )\nHIDE COMMENTS Copyright © 2017 The Washington Times, LLC.
