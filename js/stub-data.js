		title : "North Korea’s Successful Test of an Intercontinental Missile is a Test for Trump",
		subtitle : "How will Trump respond?",
		body : "North Korea just successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile, one of its most audacious moves yet — and a vivid reminder that Pyongyang seems determined to test whether President Donald Trump is willing to turn his tough talk about the country’s nuclear threat into action.\n\nThe Hwasong-14 flew for 37 minutes, according to US Pacific Command, and traveled about 578 miles . It didn’t go as far as it could because it was shot at a high trajectory, likely to ensure it didn’t make another country believe it was being attacked. The projectile eventually landed in the sea between Japan and North Korea, but analysts believe it could have traveled as far as 4,200 miles if it had been fired with an actual intent to strike a target in case of conflict. \n\nIn response, the US and South Korea held a military exercise within 10 miles of the demilitarized zone that separates North Korea from its neighbor. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called for “ global action ” to counter North Korea, while China and Russia asked for a “ double suspension ” of the military exercise and North Korea’s weapons program. \n\nBased on the global reaction, the missile test was clearly a big deal. That’s because another of the caveats about North Korea — primarily that it didn’t have an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, that could hit the mainland United States — are steadily disappearing. “That range would not be enough to reach the lower 48 states or the large islands of Hawaii, but would allow it to reach all of Alaska,” wrote David Wright, co-director of the Union of Concerned Scientists. \n\nAnd, down the line, this test could be seen as a stepping stone to an even more threatening development. “Even if this is a 7,000-km-range missile, a 10,000-km-range missile that can hit New York isn’t far off,” Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told the New York Times . \n\nWhat’s still not clear is if North Korea has the ability to miniaturize a nuclear weapon so it could be placed on the tip of the missile, and, even if it can, if the missile could reach the US and still detonate. However, Lewis told me in April that North Korea was only about five years away from being able to do that. \n\nBack in January, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said that his country was close to testing an ICBM. President Donald Trump promised that it wouldn’t happen, which could raise the pressure on the administration to do something beyond tweeting out words of disapproval. \n\nAnd that’s what’s important to keep in mind: No matter what Trump has said, or the pressure the US, China, and others try to place on North Korea, Kim continues to test missiles that could harm America and its allies. \n\nThis was not the kind of projectile Americans are used to hearing about on July Fourth. \n\nNorth Korea continues to defy international pressure \n\nTrump’s strategy for containing North Korea is to have China lean on Pyongyang to knock off its aggressive behavior. The problem is Beijing has given no sign that it’s willing to pressure its neighbor, a major Chinese trading partner. That’s left Trump, who famously said he changed his mind about North Korea after a 10-minute conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping, to take a swing at Beijing.\n\nAs my Vox colleague Zeeshan Aleem noted, the Trump administration has slapped sanctions on China because it has yet to curtail North Korea’s missile program. \n\n“While we will continue to seek international cooperation on North Korea, the United States is sending an emphatic message across the globe that we will not hesitate to take action against persons, companies, and financial institutions who enable this regime,” Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said in a June 29 statement on the sanctions, clearly alluding to China. \n\nThen again, there was little reason to believe that China was going to step up and put immense pressure on North Korea to stop its program, in part because it fears a collapse of the regime would lead to millions of desperate refugees streaming over its border. “That’s because Beijing has a vested interest in a stable North Korea — and will drag its heels as much as it can on measures that could destabilize the country,” wrote Aleem. \n\nBut the administration rightly feels there’s a growing sense of urgency to quell the threat, especially since North Korea’s missile program has improved very quickly recently. “In the past three years, North Korea has launched more major missiles than in the three previous decades combined,” noted the Wall Street Journal . This latest test is now the gold standard for North Korea. \n\nThere is some good news: The United States successfully pulled off its own test in May that showed it is capable of stopping one of these missiles before it hits American territory. Still, the US anti-ICBM system has yet to be tested against the real thing — and most hope the US never has to do that. \n\nSo for now, there is no real reason for complete panic. But there is reason to worry that one of the most dangerous and unpredictable regimes on earth is coming closer and closer to being able to hit major American cities. Trump is mired in an array of scandals and crises of his own making. This is one where the culprit is someone else — and where the solution remains painfully elusive.",

		title : "U.S. prepared to use force on North Korea 'if we must': U.N. envoy",
		subtitle : "",
		body : "UNITED NATIONS - The United States cautioned on Wednesday it was ready to use force if need be to stop North Korea's nuclear missile program but said it preferred global diplomatic action against Pyongyang for defying world powers by test launching a ballistic missile that could hit Alaska. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told a meeting of the U.N. Security Council that North Korea's actions were \"quickly closing off the possibility of a diplomatic solution\" and the United States was prepared to defend itself and its allies. \"One of our capabilities lies with our considerable military forces. We will use them if we must, but we prefer not to have to go in that direction,\" Haley said. She urged China, North Korea's only major ally, to do more to rein in Pyongyang. Speaking with his Japanese counterpart on Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis underscored the \"ironclad commitment\" of the United States to defending Japan and providing \"extended deterrence using the full range of U.S. capabilities,\" Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said in a statement. Mattis' assurances to Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada came during a phone call to discuss the North Korean test, the statement said. Taking a major step in its missile program, North Korea on Tuesday test launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that some experts believe has the range to reach the U.S. states of Alaska and Hawaii and perhaps the U.S. Pacific Northwest. North Korea says the missile could carry a large nuclear warhead. The missile test is a direct challenge to U.S. President Donald Trump, who has vowed to prevent North Korea from being able to hit the United States with a nuclear missile. He has frequently urged China to press the isolated country's leadership to give up its nuclear program. Haley said the United States would propose new U.N. sanctions on North Korea in coming days and warned that if Russia and China did not support the move, then “we will go our own path.” Related Coverage Can U.S. defend against North Korea missiles? Not everyone agrees Russia says military force against N.Korea should be excluded U.S. diplomat heads to Asia but no talks with North Korea scheduled     She did not give details on what sanctions would be proposed, but outlined possible options. \"The international community can cut off the major sources of hard currency to the North Korean regime. We can restrict the flow of oil to their military and their weapons programs. We can increase air and maritime restrictions. We can hold senior regime officials accountable,\" Haley said. Diplomats say Beijing has not been fully enforcing existing international sanctions on its neighbor and has resisted tougher measures, such as an oil embargo, bans on the North Korean airline and guest workers, and measures against Chinese banks and other firms doing business with the North. “Much of the burden of enforcing U.N. sanctions rests with China,” Haley said. The United States might seek to take unilateral action and sanction more Chinese companies that do business with North Korea, especially banks, U.S. officials have said. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un looks on during the test-launch of the intercontinental ballistic missile Hwasong-14 in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang July 5, 2017. KCNA/via REUTERS China's U.N. ambassador, Liu Jieyi, told the Security Council meeting that the missile launch was a \"flagrant violation\" of U.N. resolutions and \"unacceptable.\" \"We call on all the parties concerned to exercise restraint, avoid provocative actions and belligerent rhetoric, demonstrate the will for unconditional dialogue and work actively together to defuse the tension,\" Liu said. Tensions With u.s. The United States has remained technically at war with North Korea since the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty and the past six decades have been punctuated by periodic rises in antagonism and rhetoric that have always stopped short of a resumption of active hostilities. Tensions have risen sharply after North Korea conducted two nuclear weapons tests last year and carried out a steady stream of ballistic missile tests North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said the ICBM test completed his country's strategic weapons capability that includes atomic and hydrogen bombs, the state KCNA news agency said. Slideshow (18 Images) Pyongyang will not negotiate with the United States to give up those weapons until Washington abandons its hostile policy against the North, KCNA quoted Kim as saying. \"He, with a broad smile on his face, told officials, scientists and technicians that the U.S. would be displeased ... as it was given a 'package of gifts' on its 'Independence Day,'\" KCNA said, referring to the missile launch on July 4. Trump and other leaders from the Group of 20 nations meeting in Germany this week are due to discuss steps to rein in North Korea's weapons program, which it has pursued in defiance of Security Council sanctions. Russia's deputy U.N. envoy said on Wednesday that military force should not be considered against North Korea and called for a halt to the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea. He also said that attempts to strangle North Korea economically were \"unacceptable\" and that sanctions would not resolve the issue. The U.S. military assured Americans that it was capable of defending the United States against a North Korean ICBM. Pentagon spokesman Navy Captain Jeff Davis noted a successful test last month in which a U.S.-based missile interceptor knocked down a simulated incoming North Korean ICBM. \"So we do have confidence in our ability to defend against the limited threat, the nascent threat that is there,\" he told reporters. He acknowledged though that previous U.S. missile defense tests had shown \"mixed results.\" The North Korean launch this week was both earlier and \"far more successful than expected,\" said U.S.-based missile expert John Schilling, a contributor to Washington-based North Korea monitoring project 38 North. It would now probably only be a year or two before a North Korean ICBM achieved \"minimal operational capability,\" he added. Schilling said the U.S. national missile defense system was \"only minimally operational\" and would take more than two years to upgrade to provide more reliable defense.

		body : "It was a Fourth of July firework that President Trump once vowed would never get off the ground, but the intercontinental Hwasong-14 missile launched Tuesday by North Korea has the potential to alter permanently the balance of power in East Asia. U.S. and international military analysts were still scrambling to determine the exact capabilities of the missile, but there was little question Pyongyang had made a quantum leap in its military reach, with the 37-minute flight that soared 1,700 miles into the atmosphere before landing 500 miles to the east in the East Sea/Sea of Japan. On a flatter trajectory, analysts say, the same missile could threaten all of Alaska. \n\nSEE ALSO: Kim vows North Korea’s nukes are not on negotiation table\n\nEven as the launch was being studied, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson appeared to confirm Tuesday night that the U.S. government believes that North Korea possesses an intercontinental ballistic missile. “Testing an ICBM represents a new escalation of the threat to the U.S., our allies and partners, and the world,\” Mr. Tillerson said in a statement. In what could be seen as an expression of mounting U.S. frustration with China , Mr. Tillerson said, “Any country that hosts North Korean guest workers, provides any economic or military benefits or fails to fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions is aiding and abetting a dangerous regime.” \n\nSEE ALSO: Nikki Haley seeks emergency meeting of U.N. Security Council.\n\nWhile the regime of Kim Jong-un has long pursued nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them, the test Tuesday was “far more successful than expected,” U.S. missile specialist John Schilling of the North Korean monitoring program 38 North told the Reuters news agency. Many North Korea watchers believed the regime was years away from achieving what it did Tuesday. The Trump administration and governments around the region were quick to condemn the missile launch, but also faced the hard reality that there was little short of military action that would force North Korea to back down. Economically isolated and under the dictatorial control of the Kim regime, Pyongyang has frustrated multiple U.S. presidents who have tried to slow down its drive for nuclear weapons. \“There is no good option here,\” former acting CIA Director Michael J. Morell told “CBS This Morning.” “There is no option to [take out the North’s nuclear programs] that wouldn’t start a second Korean war and wouldn’t raise the possibility of [ Mr. Kim ] using nuclear weapons against his neighbors.\” Japan , South Korea and the U.S. have scheduled an emergency meeting at the Group of 20 summit this week in Hamburg, Germany. The North’s provocative military activities already figured to be a major topic of conversation. In a series of tweets before he took office, Mr. Trump predicted that North Korea ’s acquisition of a nuclear bomb that could threaten the U.S. mainland \“won’t happen.\” He belittled Mr. Kim and again expressed frustration that China , the North’s economic lifeline and sole ally, had failed to rein in its troublesome neighbor. On Monday, Mr. Trump tweeted, “Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?” The president, who has said the \“era of strategic patience” with the North is over, suggested that regional allies of China and the U.S. now have a greater incentive to take a tough approach. “Hard to believe South Korea and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all.\” One American response came swiftly as the U.S. 8th Army said in a statement that the U.S. and South Korean militaries fired precision “deep strike” missiles in response. The missiles landed in South Korea’s territorial waters, the statement said. But with the U.N. Security Council expected to take up the North Korean missile launch at a closed-door session Wednesday, China and Russia implied that Washington’s moves were exacerbating the crisis. \“China ’s role is indispensable,\” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said after calling the North’s missile tests a clear violation of U.N. sanctions. \“We hope all sides can meet each other halfway.\” In a joint statement, China and Russia are proposing that the North agree to suspend its ballistic missile testing program in exchange for a halt to joint South Korean-U.S. military exercises. The Pentagon says the exercises are vital to protect its ally, which is living under the threat of Pyongyang ’s conventional military forces. North Korea has condemned the exercises as a rehearsal for an invasion. Beijing and Moscow also took the opportunity to condemn the newly installed U.S. THAAD missile defense system in South Korea, which both countries fear can be used against their missiles. The launch was the 12th this year for North Korea , but the regime clearly saw the range and scope of the Hwasong-14 as a possible game-changer. Footage on state-controlled TV showed Mr. Kim and his generals monitoring the test in real time, and the female newscaster who typically announces such breakthroughs said the purported home-grown ICBM was a \“glistening miracle\” that demonstrated the “unwithering power of our state.\” While the world has condemned the North’s nuclear and missile programs as deeply destabilizing, the North Koreans insisted they were acting in self-defense. As a nuclear power with an ICBM \“capable of hitting any part of the world,\” North Korea \“will fundamentally terminate the U.S. nuclear war threats and blackmail and credibly protect the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula and the region,\” Pyongyang said in a statement read on national TV. North Korean officials said the missile was launched at an unusually high trajectory to keep it from hitting any other countries in the region. On a flatter trajectory, military analysts calculated Tuesday, the missile could fly more than 4,000 miles. Despite the North’s boasting, Western analysts say Pyongyang still faces significant technical hurdles in improving the reliability of its missiles and in fashioning a nuclear device small enough to fit on the missile. Two tests this year were abruptly terminated shortly after launch in what are still unexplained circumstances. The latest test began at approximately 9:40 a.m. local time Tuesday from an airfield near the northwestern town of Kusong. Japanese officials said they believe the missile landed in the ocean inside Japan ’s exclusive economic zone — a target possibly chosen to make recovery and analysis of the missile hard for the U.S. and its allies. Aside from Mr. Trump ’s tweets and Mr. Tillerson ’s statement, the U.S. administration largely kept to its policy of not officially reacting to North Korean missile tests. With Congress in recess for the Fourth of July , the reaction on Capitol Hill was muted too. Sen. Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, pressed Mr. Trump in a statement to consider direct diplomacy with the North and \“increased economic sanctions pressure from China .\” Mr. Trump “must realize that there is no military solution to this threat,\” Mr. Markey said. \“Unilateral action will only escalate tension, increase the paranoia of Kim Jong-un and bring us closer to what everyone agrees would be a catastrophic war.” Private analysts largely agreed that the U.S. and its allies were facing a series of bad choices over what to do about North Korea , and that time was slipping away. Patrick Cronin, an Asia analyst with the Center for a New American Security, told The Associated Press that Mr. Trump was probably \“coming to the point of no return\” with North Korea . \“We either go to the diplomatic table with Kim Jong-un or we do take some course of action,\” Mr. Cronin said. “In all probability, we do both.\” This article is based in part on wire service reports.",

		title : "Joint Chiefs: We Won't Implement a Trans Ban Until Trump Tells Us What His Tweets Mean",
		subtitle : "",
		img : "",
		body : "On Thursday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford informed the military that the Pentagon would not implement a ban on transgender troops \“until the President's direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance.\” Until that point, Dunford wrote, there \“will be no modifications to the current policy,\” and “we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect.\” About 15,000 transgender troops are currently serving openly in the United States military. In June of 2016, then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced that already-serving transgender troops could come out without fear of discharge. He also established a plan to let openly transgender people enroll in the military within one year. On Wednesday morning, however, Trump declared on Twitter that \“the United States Government will not accept or allow\” transgender individuals \“to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.\” Trump’s proclamation raised the real possibility that the thousands of transgender troops in uniform might be purged. But Trump made his announcement without consulting the Pentagon. He reportedly did not even discuss the issue with his Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, who has strongly supported open transgender service in the past. Trump’s sudden decision threatened to jettison years of careful planning and preparation on the part of the military. It also left military leaders in a lurch, caught between the president’s tweets and formal policy. The Navy has clarified that, at least for now, transgender troops may still serve and receive transition-related medical care; Dunford’s letter makes clear that remains official policy in every branch of the armed forces. It is not surprising that the military would continue to adhere to settled policy until it is explicitly revoked. But Dunford’s careful wording indicates real discomfort with Trump’s declaration. By writing that \“we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect,\” Dunford strongly implies that Trump’s policy would entail treating service members with disrespect. And his follow-up—\“As importantly, given the current fight and the challenges we face, we will all remain focused on accomplishing our assigned missions\”—suggests that Trump’s tweets are a distraction. (His statement also makes clear that the sheer incompetance and communication breakdown we have come to expect from this administration is alive and well.) The Pentagon is not defying Trump. But it is signaling its discomfort, and perhaps even irritation, with his abrupt attack on transgender individuals who simply want to serve their country in uniform. Mattis will soon have to decide whether to escalate this discomfort into concrete pushback.",

		title : "Trump Ban on Transgender Service Members Alarms Some Military Officers",
		subtitle : "",
		body : "U.S. President Donald Trump's sudden decision to ban transgender personnel from serving in the military has alarmed some senior military officers who were caught off guard by it. Trump's declaration, which came via early morning tweets on Wednesday, appeared to pre-empt an ongoing Pentagon review looking into allowing openly transgender recruits to join the military, and he drew criticism from three senior officers interviewed by Reuters on Thursday. \"I hope our commander in chief understands that we don't transmit orders via Twitter, and that he can't, either,\" one said by telephone, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \"Even if this were an order, implementing it legally would take considerable time, if it's even possible. \" Rights groups and some lawmakers from both parties accused Trump of politically motivated discrimination and said the decision creates uncertainty for transgender active-duty service members and reservists, who say they number in the thousands.. The United States' top military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, told the armed forces on Thursday there had been no change yet to Pentagon policy on transgender personnel. Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged the uncertainty that followed Trump's announcement in a note to service chiefs, commanders and senior enlisted leaders. \"I know there are questions about yesterday's announcement on the transgender policy by the President, \" Dunford wrote. \"There will be no modifications to the current policy until the President's direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance,\" Dunford said in the message, first reported by Reuters. His message neither voiced support nor opposition to Trump's decision. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Dunford in a separate message sent more narrowly to heads of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force acknowledged that Trump's announcement on Wednesday was \"unexpected.\" The Defense Department had been expected to begin formally allowing transgender people to enlist this year. But Mattis on June 30 approved a six-month delay to allow for a review. As a presidential candidate, Trump last year had vowed to fight for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people. His move on Wednesday was praised by conservative activists and some fellow Republicans. The White House said Trump had \"extensive discussions with his national security team,\" and that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was informed after the president decided on Tuesday to go ahead. Dunford then made the assurance that the military would \"treat all of our personnel with respect.",

		title : "Defense Department to Trump on Transgender Ban: Not So Fast",
		subtitle : "",
		body : "The Department of Defense declared Thursday there will be \“no modifications to the current policy\” on transgender service members for now, a day after President Trump issued a surprise three-tweet directive banning those troops from the military. In a memo to service chiefs and commanders, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford, Jr. declared no changes to the policy until \"the President’s direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance\" -- which has not yet happened. \“In the meantime, we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect,\” Dunford said in the memo obtained by Fox News.  \“As importantly, given the current fight and the challenges we face, we will all remain focused on accomplishing our assigned missions.\” Dunford’s statement suggests Defense Secretary James Mattis wasn’t given any significant heads up on the policy change. Mattis was on vacation when Trump tweeted. Mattis has also been publicly silent amid questions about Trump’s announced ban, though the White House said Wednesday that Mattis was \"immediately informed\" of Trump's decision. Dunford himself was not aware that Trump was going to announce the ban, a U.S. official said. Trump’s Wednesday morning tweets reversed an Obama-era policy of allowing transgender troops to serve. Trump wrote: \"After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow...Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming...victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you.\" The president’s tweets came only a few weeks after Defense Secretary James Mattis said he would give military chiefs another six months to conduct a review to determine if allowing transgender individuals to enlist in the armed services will affect the “readiness or lethality” of the force. The deadline for that review was Dec. 1, 2017. \“This is worse than don’t ask don’t tell, this is don’t serve, don’t serve,\” The National Center for Transgender Equality said in a written statement. \“This is an appalling attack on our service members; it is about bigotry rather than military readiness, reason or science. It is indefensible and cannot stand.\” The Family Research Council praised Trump’s action. \“I applaud President Trump for keeping his promise to return to military priorities – and not continue the social experimentation of the Obama era that has crippled our nation’s military,\” FRC President Tony Perkins said in a statement. \“The military can now focus its efforts on preparing to fight and win wars rather than being used to advance the Obama social agenda.\” Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said \"we don't need to be experimenting with the military. Plus there's no reason to take on that kind of financial burden.\" But Trump himself tweeted during the campaign season that he would \"fight\" for the LGBTQ community while his opponent \"Hillary (Clinton) brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.\" During his confirmation hearing in January, Mattis was asked whether he believed that allowing LGBT Americans to serve in the military or women in combat would undermine the military’s lethality. \“Frankly, senator, I’ve never cared much about two consenting adults and who they go to bed with,\” Mattis testified. Abbie Goldberg, professor of psychology at Clark University who has researched and written about the LGBTQ community, told Fox News \“no one wins under Trump’s plan.\” \“Some people will not serve, which is a loss to the military and the country,\” Goldberg said. \“Others will serve, but not openly, and thus they will be at risk for discharge or verbal, physical and sexual abuse.\” The Pentagon has refused to release any data on the number of transgender troops currently serving. A RAND study found that there are between 2,500 and 7,000 transgender service members in the active-duty military, and another 1,500 to 4,000 in the reserves. The study also found that allowing transgender people to serve in the military would have a \"minimal impact\" on the health care costs. The Pentagon announced it would \“continue to work closely with the White House to address the new guidance provided by the commander in chief on transgender individuals serving in the military.\” \“We will provide revised guidance to the Department in the near future,\” Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said in statement. Trump’s announcement comes as lawmakers on Capitol Hill debate the current practice of requiring the Pentagon to pay for medical treatment for gender transition. Missouri Republican Rep. Vicky Hartzler offered an amendment that would prohibit the Pentagon from spending money on transition surgeries or hormone therapy. Her amendment was narrowly defeated earlier this month. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called Trump’s decision a \“cruel and arbitrary decision designed to humiliate transgender Americans.\” \“On this very day in 1948, President Harry Truman signed the executive order desegregating the U.S. military. Sixty-nine years later, President Trump has chosen this day to unleash a vile and hateful agenda that will blindside thousands of patriotic Americans already serving with honor and bravery,\” she said. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., slammed the sudden announcement and said anyone who is fit to serve in the military should be allowed to do so. \“The president’s tweet this morning regarding transgender Americans in the military is yet another example of why major policy announcements should not be made via Twitter,\” McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said. Transgender service members have been able to serve openly in the military since last year, when former Defense Secretary Ash Carter ended the ban. Since October 1, transgender troops have been able to receive medical care and start formally changing their gender identifications in the Pentagon's personnel system. But Carter also gave the services until July 1 to develop policies to allow people already identifying as transgender to newly join the military, if they meet physical, medical and other standards, and have been stable in their identified genders for 18 months. \"I continue to maintain that what matters in choosing those who serve is that they are best qualified,\" Carter said in a statement. \"To choose service members on other grounds than military qualifications is social policy and has no place in our military. There are already transgender individuals who are serving capably and honorably. This action would also send the wrong signal to a younger generation thinking about military service.\” Key concerns include whether currently enlisted troops have had medical or other issues that cause delays or problems with their ability to deploy or meet physical or other standards for their jobs. Military leaders also wanted to review how transgender troops are treated, if they're discriminated against or if they have had disciplinary problems, the officials said. They were not authorized to discuss internal deliberations publicly, so spoke on condition of anonymity.",
